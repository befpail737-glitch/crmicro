            <div class="article-content">
                <p>CRMICRO today announced the launch of its next-generation silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) product families, designed to deliver improved efficiency and performance for high-power applications. The new devices advance CRMICRO's position in the rapidly growing wide bandgap semiconductor market.</p>
                
                <h2>New SiC MOSFET Family</h2>
                <p>The new SiC MOSFET family features improved figures of merit (FOM) compared to previous-generation devices. Key specifications include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>650V and 1200V ratings with best-in-class RDS(on)</li>
                    <li>Enhanced gate oxide reliability</li>
                    <li>Improved body diode characteristics</li>
                    <li>Lower Qg and Qoss for reduced switching losses</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These improvements enable higher efficiency and power density in applications such as electric vehicle chargers, on-board chargers, and industrial power supplies.</p>
                
                <h2>New GaN HEMT Family</h2>
                <p>CRMICRO's new GaN HEMTs (High Electron Mobility Transistors) offer enhanced performance for ultra-high frequency applications:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Exceptionally low gate and output charge</li>
                    <li>Zero reverse recovery charge</li>
                    <li>High switching speeds with minimal switching losses</li>
                    <li>Enhancement-mode operation for easy drive requirements</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The GaN devices are particularly well-suited for consumer fast charging, telecom power supplies, and other high-frequency applications where power density is critical.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Our new SiC and GaN families represent a significant advancement in wide bandgap technology," said the Director of Power Device Technology at CRMICRO. "These devices enable our customers to achieve new levels of efficiency and power density in their applications, supporting the industry's move toward more sustainable and compact power systems."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h2>Applications and Benefits</h2>
                <p>The new devices provide specific benefits for key applications:</p>
                
                <h3>Electric Vehicle Charging</h3>
                <p>SiC MOSFETs enable higher efficiency in EV charging systems, reducing thermal management requirements and allowing for more compact designs. The improved devices can achieve >98% efficiency in DC-DC converters.</p>
                
                <h3>Fast Charging</h3>
                <p>GaN HEMTs are ideal for high-power consumer adapters and chargers, enabling solutions above 100W while maintaining small form factors. The high switching frequency capability reduces magnetic component size significantly.</p>
                
                <h3>Industrial Power Supplies</h3>
                <p>Both SiC and GaN devices offer significant advantages in industrial applications where high efficiency and high power density are important. The new devices enable systems with improved thermal performance and longer component lifetimes.</p>
                
                <h2>Market Position</h2>
                <p>The launch of these new wide bandgap products positions CRMICRO to capture growing market share in applications requiring high-performance power conversion. The global SiC and GaN market is projected to grow at over 20% annually through 2030, driven by requirements for improved efficiency in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.</p>
                
                <h2>Availability and Support</h2>
                <p>The new SiC and GaN products are available in standard power packages including TO-247, D2PAK, and PQFN. Engineering samples are available immediately, with full production capacity expected by early 2026.</p>
                
                <p>CRMICRO provides comprehensive support for designers implementing these new devices, including application notes, reference designs, and technical support from specialized FAEs with wide bandgap expertise.</p>
                
                <p>The new products are manufactured at CRMICRO's advanced fabrication facilities and are backed by the company's quality and reliability standards suitable for automotive and industrial applications.</p>
